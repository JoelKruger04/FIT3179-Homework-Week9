            <h3>Major Rail Projects and Rolling Stock</h3>
            <p style="padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 15px">
              Due to the rapid population growth of Melbourne in the past 50 years, the rail network has to evolve to keep up with demand.
              Although rolling stock has been evolving, with higher capacity trains to become more common, 
              the last major rail project completed in Melbourne was the City Loop, which opened more than 40 years ago.
              However, the Metro Tunnel is set to open next year, boosting the capacity of the Pakenham, Cranbourne and Sunbury lines.

            <p style="padding-top: 20px; padding-right: 15px">
              Despite the rapid increase of Melbourne's population, the usage of trains, trams and buses is lower than it was in 2019.
              This is mostly due to changes in the lives of many Melburnians, with work and study now commonly undertaken at home, especially
              when public transport is found to be inconvenient. Nevertheless, investment in the rail network will always be crucial to reducing road congestion
              and increase access to essential services.

            <p style="padding-right: 15px">Despite the rise of remote work, the majority of Australians still drive themselves to work.
              Although convenient, this reliance on personal vehicles contributes to traffic congestion and urban pollution.
              The prioritisation of public transport, along with more flexible work and study arrangements, would allow Australians to reduce their environmental impact,
              as well as decrease travel times for all.

                  The map shows the average weekday patronage of each
                  metropolitan train station, overlayed in front of the
                  population growth for each LGA (local government area). The
                  high concentation of rail traffic in the inner city is due to
                  the radial nature of Melbourne's train network and the lack of
                  any linkages of train lines.

                  this flaw by allowing travellers to travel around the city and
                  avoid the CBD, while creating economic hubs that are easily
                  accessible
